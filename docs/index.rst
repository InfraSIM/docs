InfraSIM allows you to deploy virtualized infrastructures consisting of simulated servers, storage devices, switches and smart PDUs(Power Distribute Units). You can use it to create development environments that simulate the exact physical environments where your product will eventually be deployed.

The project is a collection of libraries and applications housed at https://github.com/InfraSIM/ and available under
the Apache 2.0 license (or compatible sublicenses for library dependencies). The code for InfraSIM is a combination
of python, shell and C, etc.
