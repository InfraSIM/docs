vNode Deployment and Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Deploy virtual Compute Node to ESXi manually
    The virtual compute node OVA image is a **standard** image that can be deployed to ESXi directly.

    **Notes:** Login to the ESXi server through SSH and echo by issuing the "vhv.enable = "TRUE"" command to the /etc/vmware/config file. This command enables nested ESXi and other hypervisors in vSphere 5.1 or higher version. This step only needs to be done once by using the command: echo 'vhv.enable = "TRUE"' >> /etc/vmware/config.

#. Deploy virtual compute node by vRackSystem
    Please access `vRackSystem User Manual <userguide.html#vracksystem-user-manual>`_ for more information.
