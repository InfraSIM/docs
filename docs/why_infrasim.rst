InfraSIM Use Cases
------------------------------------

Currently, InfraSIM has successfully proved that it is capable of not only saving lots of cost of purchasing hardware material for setting up a pure bare-metal environment, but also providing many flexibilities in software developing and testing areas. Here's one example of how InfraSIM is leveraged as part of test solution for RackHD™:

**Notes:**
RackHD™ is an open source project that provides hardware orchestration and management through RESTful APIs. For more information about RackHD, go to http://rackhd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

#. At scale test
    We can validate RackHD functionalities by having it manage and orchestrate a virtual infrastructure with adjustable or big scalability. Then we can evaluate RackHD performance benchmark and ensure its functionatlies in an environment with:
       * Big number of nodes
       * Diversity of node type - different type, model, vendors, etc
       * Increased complexity of network topology

#. Telemetry data testing
    InfraSIM allows generating and modifying server sensor readings that we can better test feature of telemetry data of RackHD.

#. Node provision
    InfraSIM allows customizing node device tree and manipulating FE behavior, we can better test node provision feature, for example, bootstrapping servers and deploying operating systems, hypervisors and applications.

#. Error injection
    Because InfraSIM is adopting software approach to simulate hardware, both elements and entire infrastructure, it provided more feasibility and easiness to simulate hardware failures to test our software error handing logic.
